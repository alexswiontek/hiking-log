# Hiking Log

A hiking logger that includes your recent hikes and their difficulty

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```

## API

The baseURL is set in `nuxt.config.js`, where both dev and production links can be found. The local build will require the `hiking-log-api` repo to be running at the same time as this repo.

```bash
cd ../hiking-log-api
npm start
```
